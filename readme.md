3. Is giving div dimensions extra code ?

4. Thought of using grid. There is no need as the table like content is not required. So, I stuck with the flex property.

5. Need to use Grid css for not using unique margin for each row within unique style 

6. Giving margin for each tag makes the code harder to use
- So, the solution could be to use grid-template-columns 

7. How to give dimensions for images ?
- have img tag inside a div tag and give width dimension in percentages

## Githubtips
Github helped
- developers to contribute from any geographical location
- developers to contribute when offline
- previously we had to find specific developer community
- Github's user interface makes it easier to operate

- git init: It creates a new repository. git clone has git init inside the hood
- git add: nuanced saving step before the actual saving with "git commit"
- Is it possible to make changes and 'git add' them ? Would they be "saved" and not lost if the laptop broke down not opening ? 
- git commit: saving the changes
- git push: pushes the commits to the remote repository
- git config: name and email would be associated with any commit you create
